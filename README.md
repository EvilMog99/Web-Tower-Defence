# Web-Tower-Defence
Multiplayer Tower Defence game

This is a web game programmed in HTML5 and JavaScript.
The client side uses the graphics library p5.js and the server uses Node.js to opperate.

Run the server by opening Windows PowerShell or the CMD in the "server" folder, and running: node server.js
To connect to the server open a web browser and load localhost (http://127.0.0.1:3000/)

Currently there is a bug that causes the buildings placed on the map not to show up if the client's canvas is too small incomparison to their screen size.
To fix this go to "Settings" and select a new screen width and height.
Sorry if the GUI doesn't rescale for all canvas sized - it's a working progress.

Users may download and view the code, as well as use small parts of it in their projects, but may not copy or release large parts as their own work.
